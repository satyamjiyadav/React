Qus : what is the alternative of npm?
Ans : yarn developed by facebook.

Qus : what is current version of react?
Ans : package.json me dekh lo.

Qus : what is difference between package.json and package.json-lock?
Ans : package-lock has history and detail of all packages(node modules) and its integrity.
    : package.json has details of application.

Qus : Src folder?
Ans : kaam ki cheeche hoti hai isme.

Qus : index.js?
Ans : entry point of react.

Qus : what is component?
Ans : A part of large thing.
      A piece of code that can reuse.
      Such as Function.
      But more powerful than function.
      Header, footer is best example.

Qus : How many types of components are there in react?
Ans : mainly two types k hote hai:
      (1) Functional Component.
      (2) Class Component.

       -->Some are other also

       Hoc (high order component).
       pure component.
       controlled component.
       uncontrolled component.

Qus : JSX?
Ans : javascript xml(jsx) earlier we can't use javascript and html togeher we use script for that.
      But now in react we can write html and javascripttogetther.
      ex user.js wali fie me likh k dekkh lo.

Qus : can we use angular and react together?
Ans : yes, react is a library and angular is a framework.
      so, we ca use a library inside a framewok.

Qus : state?
Ans : just like variable . used to stare data;
      when we use state on changing anything react directly pta kr leta ha aur page me show kr deta hai chnage ko.
      variable me change krenge to react will not recognise.

Qus : Re-rendering?
Ans : ek component phir se update hua hai.

Qus : can we use state outside state?
Ans :

Qus : is state public or private ?
Ans : In React.js, the state is private and fully controlled by the component 
      that defines it1. This means that the state cannot be accessed or 
      modified directly from outside the component. Instead, it can only be updated 
      within the component itself using the setState method.


Qus : what is props?
Ans : In React, props (short for “properties”) are a mechanism for passing data 
      from a parent component to a child component. 
      They allow you to customize and configure child components by providing 
      them with values or functions


Ques : what is the difference between life cycle method and phase ?
Ans : there are so many life cycle methods but there are only 3 phase.
      (1) Mounting
      (2) Updating
      (3) UnMounting


Key Differences Between Lifecycle Methods and Phases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aspect	                      Lifecycle Method	                                           Lifecycle Phase
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it represents	A function that gets called at a specific point in time	A period or stage in the component's lifecycle
Purpose	            To execute code at specific events (like fetching data)	To define the different periods of a component’s existence
Examples	            componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate	                  Mounting, Updating, Unmounting
Level of control   	Provides control over what to do during each phase     	Represents the natural flow of a component's lifecycle


real life example
(1) turn on phone
(2) use different apps
(3) turn off the phone


Qus : Is constructor is a life cycle method ?
Ans : Yes.

Qus : what is the meaning of render method ? 
Ans : sudh hindi me (prastut krna).

The render() method in React is a special function responsible for describing the UI (User Interface) of a component.
It defines what should be displayed on the screen by returning JSX (JavaScript XML) elements, 
which React then converts into actual HTML for rendering in the browser.


Qus : component did mount?
Ans : use ->  calling api when loading page
      render called first after that compo did mount is called

Qus: diff b/w compDidMount and compDidUpdate ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aspect	                             componentDidMount()	                                                                        componentDidUpdate()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose	        Called once after the component is initially mounted (inserted into the DOM).           	Called after every update (re-render) of the component due to changes in state or props.
When it Runs        Executes only once, right after the first render() method.	                              Executes every time the component updates after render() is called (except for the initial render).
Use Cases	        Ideal for data fetching, subscriptions, setting up event listeners, or any one-time setup.	Ideal for responding to changes in props or state, such as making API calls when data changes, updating the DOM, or triggering side effects.
Example Scenario 	  Fetching data from an API when a page loads for the first time.                         	Fetching updated data when a user changes a filter option, or syncing the component when it receives new props.
Clean-Up	        Does not need explicit clean-up; however, clean-up can be done in componentWillUnmount().	Can be paired with componentWillUnmount() to handle clean-up when the component updates frequently.


deploy:
